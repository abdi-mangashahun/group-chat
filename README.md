Group Chat (Java)
Welcome to Group Chat — a real-time, interactive group messaging application built with Java using Sockets for communication. This app allows users to join chat rooms, send messages in real-time, and interact with others through a simple server-client architecture.

Features
Real-time messaging: Messages are sent and received instantly using TCP Sockets.
Multiple chat rooms: Users can join various chat rooms to communicate with others.
Custom usernames: Users can set their own usernames when they join the chat.
Simple UI: A basic console-based interface (or optional Swing UI) to interact with the chat.
Scalable server: The server can handle multiple simultaneous clients using multithreading.
Demo
If you would like to see a demo of this app in action, replace this with a link to your hosted version or a recorded demo.

Group Chat Demo

Technologies Used
Java: The programming language used for both the server and client.
Sockets: Used for real-time communication between the server and the clients (TCP protocol).
Swing (optional): For creating a graphical user interface (GUI) if applicable.
Multithreading: To handle multiple simultaneous client connections.
Console-based UI: If you're using a console-based UI, users can interact via the command line.
Installation
To run the Group Chat application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/socket_group-chat.git
cd group-chat
2. Compile the Java files
Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (preferably JDK 8 or later).

bash
Copy code
javac *.java
3. Start the server
To run the server, which will handle client connections, execute the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
java ChatServer
By default, the server listens for incoming connections on port 12345. You can change this in the ChatServer.java file if needed.

4. Run the client
To start a client, open another terminal window and run:

bash
Copy code
java ChatClient
You will be prompted to enter your username and the chat room you want to join. After that, you'll be able to start chatting with others in real-time.

5. Start chatting!
Once you're connected, you can send and receive messages in the selected chat room. Messages will be broadcast to all users currently in the room.

Usage
1. Join a Chat Room
When you first run the client, you'll be asked to enter a username and a chat room name. If the room doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

2. Send and Receive Messages
Messages are exchanged in real-time with all participants in the same chat room. All users connected to the room will instantly see the new messages.

3. Multiple Rooms
You can join different chat rooms. Simply type a command to switch rooms or create a new one.

4. Exit the Chat
To leave the chat room, type /exit in the chat, and you will be disconnected.

Acknowledgments
Java Sockets: For handling real-time communication via TCP connections between the server and clients.
Swing (optional): If you're using a graphical user interface for the chat.
Multithreading: Used to manage multiple clients connected to the server simultaneously.
Additional Notes
Server-Client Communication:

The ChatServer.java listens for client connections on a specified port.
The server uses multithreading to handle multiple clients at once.
Each connected client is managed in its own ClientHandler thread.
Chat Room Management: The ChatRoom.java class is responsible for creating and managing chat rooms. It handles user connections, room membership, and message broadcasting.

Basic Commands:

/exit: Disconnect from the chat room.
/list: List all active chat rooms (if applicable).
/join <room_name>: Join a specific room.
