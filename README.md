Socket Group Chat (Java)
Welcome to Socket Group Chat — a real-time group messaging application built with Java using Sockets for communication. This application allows users to join different chat rooms, send and receive messages in real-time, and interact with other users seamlessly.

Features
Real-time messaging: Messages are sent and received instantly using TCP Sockets.
Multiple chat rooms: Users can join different chat rooms and send messages within them.
Usernames: Each user can set their own username when they join the chat.
Simple, lightweight UI: Built using Java with basic Swing or console-based UI (depending on your choice).
Scalable: Handle multiple users and rooms efficiently.
Demo
If you would like to see a live demo of this app, feel free to replace this with a link to your project (e.g., a hosted version, or a recorded video).

Socket Group Chat Demo

Technologies Used
Java: Programming language used to build the application.
Sockets: Used for real-time communication between the client and server (TCP/UDP Sockets).
Swing (optional): If using a graphical user interface (GUI), Swing is used for the frontend interface.
Multithreading: Each client runs in its own thread to handle multiple simultaneous connections.
Installation
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/socket-group-chat-java.git
cd socket-group-chat-java
2. Compile the Java files
Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (preferably JDK 8 or later).

bash
Copy code
javac *.java
3. Run the server
To start the chat server, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
java ChatServer
This will start the server, which listens for incoming connections from clients.

4. Run the client
To connect a client to the server, open a new terminal window and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
java ChatClient
You’ll be prompted to enter your username and the chat room you want to join.

5. Start chatting!
Once connected, you can send and receive messages in real-time with other users in the same chat room.

Usage
1. Join a Room
When you first launch the client, you will be asked to enter your username and choose a chat room. You can join an existing room or create a new one.

2. Send and Receive Messages
Once in the room, you can send messages to everyone in that room. The application supports real-time message updates, so everyone in the room will see the messages instantly.

3. Multiple Chat Rooms
You can join different chat rooms. To switch between rooms, just type a command and reconnect to another room.

4. Exit the Chat
You can leave a chat room at any time. Simply close the client or disconnect from the server.

Acknowledgments
Java Sockets: For handling real-time communication between clients and the server.
Swing (if used): For building a simple, graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the chat.
Multithreading: Allows the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
Additional Notes:
Server-Client Communication: The ChatServer.java listens on a specific port and handles incoming connections. It then creates a ClientHandler thread for each connected client.
Multiple Chat Rooms: ChatRoom.java is responsible for creating and managing chat rooms. Each room can have multiple clients connected to it.
Concurrency: The server uses multithreading to handle multiple clients simultaneously. Each client connects in its own thread, allowing for independent communication without blocking others.
Summary
In this Java-based Socket Group Chat application:

The server listens for client connections and distributes messages across the network.
Each client communicates with the server using Sockets (TCP/IP).
Clients can join multiple chat rooms and send/receive messages in real-time.
This project is a great way to get familiar with Java Sockets, multithreading, and network programming concepts while building a real-time chat application.
